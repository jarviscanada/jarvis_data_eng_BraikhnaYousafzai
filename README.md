# Braikhna Yousafzai . Jarvis Consulting

I enjoy the growth and constant learning that comes with the software industry. I am looking to apply and grow my development and engineering skills in creative ways. I enjoy working collaboratively and across disciplines to get a comprehensive understanding of my projects and company. I appreciate team-based approaches towards a cohesive solution. I am a recent graduate from Western University with a Bachelor's degree with Specialization in Computer Science. I have worked on several Java, Python, and database management projects throughout my degree. I most enjoy the engineering, data management, and analytic aspects of the industry. Outside of work, I enjoy painting, coffee, and a good book. I am also quite involved with my community in volunteering and leadership capacities.

## Highlighted Projects
**COVID-19 Graphing Program** [[GitHub](https://github.com/bmaqs/CS3307-Assignments/tree/master/A1)]: This project pulls Covid-19 tracking data from an API and sorts the data in ascending or descending order depending on user input. It graphs the data to show various trends such as countries with highest number of total cases or countries with highest number of deaths.

It also allows consumers to easily report COVID-19 cases they have experienced as well as easily receive notifications about potential exposures.
