# Braikhna Yousafzai . Jarvis Consulting

I enjoy the growth and constant learning that comes with the software industry. I am looking to apply and grow my development and engineering skills in creative ways. I enjoy working collaboratively and across disciplines to understand my projects and company comprehensively. I appreciate team-based approaches towards a cohesive solution. I am a recent graduate from Western University with a Bachelor's degree with Specialization in Computer Science. I have worked on several Java, Python, and database management projects throughout my degree. I most enjoy the engineering, data management, and analytic aspects of the industry. I enjoy painting, coffee, and a good book outside of work. I am also quite involved with my community in volunteering and leadership capacities.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BraikhnaYousafzai](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BraikhnaYousafzai)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BraikhnaYousafzai/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BraikhnaYousafzai/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a Linux cluster monitoring agent using Shell scripts inserting hardware usage data for each cluster node into a PostgreSQL database. The data was collected in real-time using a crontab job and persisted using PostgreSQL. SQL queries were run to perform analytics on the cluster such as creating groups of nodes and determining average memory consumption. The project was deployed using a docker container, and version control was maintained through GitHub.


## Highlighted Projects
**COVID-19 Graphing Program** [[GitHub](https://github.com/bmaqs/CS3307-Assignments/tree/master/A1)]: Programmed a COVID-19 data tracker using C++ to allow for visual representations of worldwide COVID-19 trends. The project pulls COVID-19 data from API and the `iterator` object and `sort` function are used to parse and sort the data. The data is then graphed according to user input. This app issues graphical representation of trends such as countries with highest total case counts and countries with highest total death counts.

**COVID 19 Contact Tracing System** [[GitHub](https://github.com/bmaqs/CS3307-Assignments/tree/master/Group-45-Project)]: Programmed a software allowing businesses to track incidences of COVID-19 in their establishments and automate exposure notifications to their customer base. A customer interface is implemented to allow customers to easily report their positive COVID-19 cases as well as receive notifications about potential exposures. The business and customer data is persisted on an online database server and notifications are sent out through a pipe. The GUI was converted to a UI using XML. This project was a collaborative submission for a Object Oriented Programming course.
